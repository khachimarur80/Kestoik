## Logs

Logs are records of the activities you perform throughout the day. Each log entry includes the activity name, start time, and end time.

## Objectives

In Kestoik, we establish campaigns, which represent long-term goals or tasks. Within each campaign, we break down our daily tasks. For each task, we specify the campaign it belongs to.

## Review

At the end of each day, we conduct a review of our logs and objectives. In our log review, we focus on reducing the time between tasks, eliminating inefficient actions, and optimizing the order of tasks. As for our objectives, we track our progress in each campaign.
